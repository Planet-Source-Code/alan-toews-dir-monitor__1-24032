### Description

ActiveX dll source code & test project which monitors a directory for changes. It will watch for files being added or deleted, and changes in attributes or size, and raise an event when a change occurs.

I have not used any api calls for this, so there ARE more efficient ways to write this code.

I needed to get it done, and was having too much trouble with the api calls working smoothly.

I don't care if you vote, but would really appreciate constructive comments.

Thx
 
### More Info
 
Name of path to watch

Reference the dll and declare it WithEvents in your app. (See sample included)

name of file or folder changed, and the type of change that occured.

None that I know of.
